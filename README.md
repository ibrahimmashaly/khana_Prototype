### What is Khana?
Communities all around the world suffer from a lack of participation. This is especially prevalent in crypto-communities, where stakeholder participation is very low, adversely affecting their desired outcome.
Khana is a suite of tools to further engage and increase sustainable participation in communities, using crypto-economic incentives such as dynamic token bonding curves. 

For a deeper discussion, see:

A related but separate project is [Bonded Donations](https://github.com/mrdavey/BondedDonations).

# Status
We created a Proof of Concept (PoC) in September 2018. The implementation (smart contracts + front end code) can be found in the [Proof of Concept directory](https://github.com/mrdavey/KhanaFramework/tree/master/Khana%20POC). 

The PoC is currently deployed to a handful of communities in Amsterdam, Netherlands on Rinkeby testnet. It is actively being used and tested.

We have begun work on the MVP, with the smart contracts remaining open source. See the [contracts directory](https://github.com/mrdavey/KhanaFramework/tree/master/contracts).

#### We're hoping to work on Khana full-time in the near future, so if you would like to support us, please reach out!
